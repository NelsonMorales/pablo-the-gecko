                The most recognizable feature of the crested gecko is the appearance of eyelash like projections above the eyes, as mentioned previously. These eyelashes protrude above the eyes that feature on either side of the crested gecko’s wedge-shaped head. The head of the crested gecko features a crest (hence the name) that travels from the midpoint of each eye to the center of the back and then runs down the tail. The crested gecko is covered in small setae or hairs that appear on the end of the tail as well as the toes, these setae are composed of small spatula or hairs that allow the gecko to climb on various surfaces. While the toes of the gecko play an important role in the gecko’s ability to climb, when the toes are not able to adequately grip a surface the small setae allow for traction.
                The crested gecko comes in a variety of colors but they are most commonly recognized for being an orange color. These geckos can also be gray, red, brown and yellow and have a number of different markings that can appear as spots, tiger stripes or straight stripes. To date there has been no evidence that these markings or colorations are indicative of the gecko’s geographic location or familial traits.

              The crested gecko is a mostly nocturnal gecko that prefers to live in the trees of New Caledonia. During the daytime these geckos can be found sleeping in the rainforest trees; however, at night these reptiles are found hunting for food. Interestingly the colors of the crested gecko become much brighter during the night. Like many lizards the crested gecko will drop its tail when it feels threatened by a predator; however, unlike other reptiles this gecko does not re-grow its tail once it is lost. One thing that tends to disturb many first time owners who experience their gecko dropping its tail is that when the tail is dropped it may continue to move for as long as five minutes before appearing “dead.” It may seem painful for any animal to lose an appendage particularly one that will not grow back; however, the tail loss process for the crested gecko is quick and relatively bloodless. After losing their tail the crested gecko experiences no considerable problem living both in the wild and in captivity as tailless geckos.

                Breeding season runs from February through September. Females will lay 2 eggs every 30-45 days during this period. The animals should be cooled from October through January. Lizards devote varying degrees of parental care to their offspring. Most species are oviparous, and deposit calcified eggs, while some are ovoviviparous, retaining their young internally, inside flexible, transparent shells that hatch near the time of parturition. Other lizards, called viviparous species, give live birth and use placenta-like connections with their young. Despite this variation, very few species provide care to their young once they are born or have hatched.

                The crested gecko is found in New Caledonia like all species of the Rhacodactylus genus. More specifically the crested gecko is found in the south province of New Caledonia. To date, there are three recognized populations of crested geckos that can be found on the Isle of Pines and Grand Terre island. Two of the crested gecko populations can be found on the Grand Terre Island, however they are distinct populations with one being located near the Blue River and the other being located near to Mount Dzumac.

            <p>
              <strong>Wild Eating Habits </strong><br>
              In the wild, geckos eat anything that is small enough for them to overpower or capture and consume. Insects such as crickets and grasshoppers are their mainstay dietary choice in their native unrestricted environment. Geckos will also consume arthropods such as spiders, centipedes and small scorpions. Small rodents -- particularly young still in the nest -- are also on their list of prey. They even have cannibalistic tastes: They will eat hatchling geckos.

              <strong>The Class Reptilia</strong><br>
              As a member of the class Reptilia, the crested gecko is characterized by the ability to breathe air and lay shelled eggs. In addition, these reptiles are also characterized by having scaled skin. These tetrapod creatures are recognized for the most part as being cold-blooded or ectothermic. As ectothermic creatures crested geckos depend upon external means of controlling their body temperatures which is why they are often seen “sunning” themselves. The metabolic rate of creatures that are cold-blooded is slow. There are currently four recognized orders of the class Reptilia: Crocodilia, Squamata, Testudines and Sphenodontia. The crested gecko is a member of the order Squamata.
